Facebook has recently changed its chat protocol.
This could mean we only be able to use its official messenger apps or the website to chat, and in future all third party apps may no longer function.

When you look at the permissions of the FB messenger app, it is clear that they have access to far more personal information than they could possibly justify needing. This includes access to Microphone, Camera, call logs, Contacts, Emails, Signal connection control, and usage info of your other apps, and all of this at any time.

If you don't want to jeapordize your mobile's privacy, and can't bear the site of the website interface
but are still somehow required to use FB to communicate, this is your friendliest option.
It cuts out all the distractions, without pulling you away from the browser.

WARNING - Facebook will still monitor your conversations with this plugin.
