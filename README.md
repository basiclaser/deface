deface - facebook defaced
=============

A reduction of facebook to the bare chat function.

Facebook has recently disallowed access the Chat API for third party apps.
This means you can use its official messenger apps or the website to chat.
I use chat function on Facebook occassionaly, but often get caught up in the other stuff the website offers.
This code cuts out all the distractions.

HOW TO

Facebook
1.In your browser, hit ctrl-o/command-o
2.Then navigate to addon-sdk-1.16/deface/ and add the deface.xpi folder.
3.Click install.
4.The extension will now allow you to open deface from a button in your browser UI.

Chrome
1.Go to facebook.com, sign in.
2.Hit control-shift C or command-shift C to open up the console
3.(Chrome) Navigate to the sources tab, right-click the left file view, and 'add new folder'.
Then add "addon-sdk-1.16/deface/data" . That folder contains the deface CSS & JS . Chrome plugin coming soon.
