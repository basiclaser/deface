deface
=============

A reduction of facebook to the bare chat function.

*Work in Progress* - *Login to facebook before installing*

Firefox version > https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deface/
Chrome version coming soon

If you don't want to get distracted by facebook, or throw away your privacy with the mobile messenger apps,
but are still somehow required to use Facebook chat.

It cuts out all the distractions, without pulling you away from the browser.

WARNING - Facebook will still monitor your conversations with this plugin.
