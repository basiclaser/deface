justmessenger
=============

A reduction of facebook to the bare chat function.

Facebook has recently disallowed access the Chat API for third party apps. This means you can use its official messenger apps or the website to chat. 
I use chat function on Facebook occassionaly, but often get caught up in the other stuff the website offers. This code cuts out all the distractions. 

HOW TO 
1.Go to facebook.com, sign in. 
2.Hit control-shift C or command-shift C to open up the console
3.(Firefox) Navigate to the style-editor in firefox, import/add the justmessenger.css file
3.(Chrome) Navigate to the sources tab, right-click the left file view, and 'add new folder'. add justmessenger folder
