deface - facebook defaced
=============

Official FF and Chrome extensions will be in their respective stores shortly.
Perhaps a node-webkit desktop chat app for linux/OSX also :).

A reduction of facebook to the bare chat function.

Facebook has recently deprecated it's current Chat API for third party apps.
This means you can use its official messenger apps or the website to chat, but in future it all third party chat apps may break.
As I live in my browser, I use the chat function on usually on facebook.com, but often get caught up in the other stuff the website offers.
This plugin cuts out all the distractions, without pulling me away from the browser.
